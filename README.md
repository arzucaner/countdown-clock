# Countdown Clock

---

**
This project is part of the JavaScript30 challenge, a series of exercises designed to help developers improve their JavaScript skills. The challenge for this project was to create a countdown timer that displays the remaining time on the screen.

The countdown timer is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and includes a simple interface with buttons for setting the timer duration and starting and stopping the countdown. The timer displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds, and includes a progress bar that visually represents the time remaining.
